This is a SPI PMOD board and holds your SPI memory chip.

Typical footprints used for SPI memory like DIP-8, SOIC-8 and SOP-8 will fit on the Frankenstein-8 footprint.

*Status*: soldered, unkown if working.

My [Kicad library](https://github.com/atoomnetmarc/ATOOMNETKICAD) is used in this project.
